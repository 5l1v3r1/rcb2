RcB2 - rofl0r's C builder 2nd generation
========================================

`rcb2` is the successor to [RcB](https://github.com/rofl0r/rcb).
It's a build system for C, where dependencies between files are documented with
the use of a special pragma inside the sourcefiles and headers.
So the code itself is the documentation how the program needs to be built.

When you run `rcb2`, you simply pass it the name of the sourcefile containing
the `main()` function, and `rcb2` figures out which other files are needed.

Cross-compilation is as simple as using an appropriate `CC` environment
variable.

## A small example:

You have a file `main.c` which, depending on some macros, shall use either
`foo.h` and `foo.c`, or `bar.h` and `bar.c`.

main.c:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef FOO
#include "foo.h"
#define func foo
#else
#include "bar.h"
#define func bar
#endif

int main() { printf("%s\n", func()); }

```

foo.h:
```c
const char *foo(void);
#pragma RcB2 DEP "foo.c"
```

foo.c:
```c
const char *foo(void) { return "foo"; }
```

bar.h:
```c
const char *bar(void);
#pragma RcB2 DEP "bar.c"
```
bar.c:
```c
const char *bar(void) { return "bar"; }
```

now you can run `CFLAGS=-DFOO rcb2 main.c` and it will produce an executable
named `main` which will print `foo` when run.
if you execute `rcb2 main.c`, the build executable will print `bar`.

you can find the example in `tests/1`.

## How to use

If a file (typically a header) requires some other files, you add a
`#pragma RcB2 DEP "../src/file1.c" "lib/file2.c"`. Globs are supported too.
All path components need to be relative to the file containing the pragma.

If a .c file requires certain CFLAGS for compilation, e.g. `-std=c99`, you can
add `#pragma RcB2 CFLAGS "-std=c99"`.

Likewise, if a certain library is needed, e.g. `-lncurses` and `-lm`, you
declare it like so: `#pragma RcB2 LINK "-lncurses" "-lm"`.

note that you could stuff both `-l` directives into the same set of double
quotes, and it would work, but it is advised to specify each library separately.
RcB2 drops duplicates to keep the compiler command line as short as possible.
The `LINK` directive is an alias for `LDFLAGS`.

The pragmas can be put between preprocessor `#if`s and `#ifdef`s.
Only those that survive the preprocessor pass are being picked up.

After all headers have the dependencies on the .c files they depend on properly
documented, it's sufficient to simply include a header, and run `rcb2` on the
file, and it will pick up all files required instantly.

By default, `rcb2` throws all .c files onto the compiler in a single pass.
This allows to use CFLAGS like `-fwhole-program` which can very efficiently
optimize the binary.

## Implementation & Design

`rcb2` simply runs the C preprocessor on the file passed on the command line,
using the supplied C/CPPFLAGS, and then parses the `#pragma RcB2` directives
that survived. All referenced files are then recursively processed in the exact
same manner, until the complete list is created. As a C preprocessor is a pretty
simple program, this is a very quick process.
Currently it is done sequentially, but it could be parallelized relatively
easily (instead of recursing, one could simply spawn a new thread when a new
dependency that wasn't processed yet is found).

After the complete list of dependencies is known, they are passed to the
compiler. That's it.

Even though the current version of `rcb2` is written in python, it is really
quick, and the concept is so simple that it could easily be rewritten in a more
performant language.

`rcb2` currently supports a `-j N` parameter. if used, instead of compiling the
required files directly, it writes a GNU make compatible makefile, and executes
it with `-j N`, speeding up the build.

At this point, all command line parameters are experimental.
Run `rcb2 --help` to get a full list of options.

## History

RcB, the previous version, used comments for the same purpose, which resulted in
a number of issues, especially in regard to conditional compilation.
while experimenting with OMP, it occured to me that using a `#pragma`
directive would be the solution to those issues, as it survives a preprocessor
pass. therefore the existing conditional compilation the preprocessor offers can
be leveraged.

RcB was also written in perl, a very ugly language, which is very hard to read
once a program has been written. Everytime a new cornercase required modifying
the code, it took a substantial amount of time to make sense of the almost
random looking pile of dollar signs and curly braces.
